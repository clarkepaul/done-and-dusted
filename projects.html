					<h2>Kids bunk bed</h2>
					<p><small>Aug 2019</small></p>
					<p>I'm building a bunk bed for the kids above the main fixed double bed. We're keeping the sleeping areas in the back so we can still use the dinning area as normal in the evenings. I want the bunk to be easily stored away when not in use so its going to fold away into the wall like a Murphy Bed.
					<p>I've purchased a foldup bed from Trademe which I'll be using for the bunk. For it to fit  I've had to take away the cupboards above the main double bed to make enough space and I'll also be moving the TV to the other side of the bus (I've removed it all together for now).</p>
					<p>Next will be to create a gaurd rail to stop Isaac fallong out of the bed.</p>

					<h2>Re-lining the bedroom</h2>
					<p><small>Sept 2019</small></p>
					<p>I had to remove some of the boards and carpet on the back wall to put in the bunk bed, while I was at it I decided to remove the ceiling fabric as it was sagging anywayâ€”so it looks like I'm pretty much redoing the whole back bedroom now. On the opposite side from the bunk there is an old large air duct which is pretty much an empty void, I've removed it as well which I'll replace with an open shelf.</p>
					<p>I was going to reline the ceiling with Gaboon (Okume) ply but decided at the last minute to go Kauri. I can slowly work my way to the front of the bus with a similar style throughout.</p>

					<p>I'll be adding two strips of LED lighting down the roof line and some fast charging USB ports to the back wall for mobile phones. I think even my laptop can charge from those USB ports? although we have an inverter onboard anyway.</p>
					<p>It's all taking a lot longer than I anticipated, all those curves and skylights, lights, light switches, and airvents to fit the ply around makes it all quite complicated.<p>
					<p>Update: so apparently Kauri ply comes from Fiji and all supplies to NZ has stopped, so now I potentially can't get anymore. When I purchased it I was assured more would br coming but I've rung around NZ to find more but there isn't any! It's all at the Fijian docks in containers with some leagal battle. What to do? continue with what I have or swap it out now for another wood.</p>

					<h2>LED lights and power points</h2>
					<p><small>Sept 2019</small></p>
					<img class="simple-image border-radius-8 right-50" src="./images/gallery/USB.png" />
					<p>With the plywood saga going on, I've moved onto wireing up the LED light strips which run down either side of the main sheet of ply which runs down the middle of the roof. I've got one side fitted and working, using a remote or phone you have the ability to dim the lights and change colours. I plan to fit another strip today above the bunk bed. So after that I'll move backj to the fitting of the remaining ply I've got left.</p>

					<h2>Movie projector</h2>
					<p><small>Sept 2019</small></p>
					<p>I've had this idea to get a projector for some time, after a bit of research I purchased one for the home which we could also use on outings in the bus.</p>
					<p>My idea is that it'll be used on the outside of the bus itself for movie nights with friends when camping, or in the courtyard at home. I don't know if it will be good enough but it's worth a try. I've used it at home on the wall successfully and the built-in speakers seem fine. I'm looking forward to trying it out properly, I just need some good family movies downloaded now.</p>

					<h2>GPS tracker installation</h2>
					<p><small>Sept 2019</small></p>
					<p>I've been pretty casual with parking my bus in places which aren't the safest, for a little bit more piece of mind I've purchased a GPS tracker for the bus.</p>
					<p>It's a fairly simple device which will alert me if it moves, or by sending it a SMS it will let me know its location.</p>
					<p>Purchased off AliExpress for about $30, so far its been easy to setup. I have it being tracked on a map, it has it's own battery incase its disconnected from the bus battery.</p>

					<h2>Bed headboard</h2>
					<p><small>Oct 2019</small></p>
					<p>Because there's a bit of a gap between the double mattress and the back wall I've made a headboard to fill the gap. It's an old foam mattress which makes for a pretty comfy headboard and provides and extra thermal layer between the sleeping area and the back of the bus.</p>
					<p>Kim had some fabric lying around which I've used to cover the foam and I had a board up in the attic to give the headboard some strentgh. I sliced the mattress up with an electric bread knife to form the shape, with special attention to ensure the bunk still goes up and down by splitting the headboard into a main piece and a smaller peice which can be used if the bunk is up or put away if the bunk is down.</p>
					<p>I might splash out at some stage to purchase some thick wool felt material to cover it but for now there's more important things to do.</p>

					<h2>Tunes</h2>
					<p><small>Oct 2019</small></p>
					<p>Something I used to do when I was younger was make mix tapes for roadtrips and holidays, bring back the old days I say! Every now and then you'd find the old playlist and it brings back those memories.</p>
					<p>I've actually dug out my old iPod fully loaded with tunes from at least 10 years ago, and my bag of mini-discs, some of those mixes are well worth digging back up. They'll plug straight into the stereo system so should be good for the drive.</p>
					<p>Here's some samples of a playlist I started to put together for a trip, unfortunately I can't provide the full length playlist for licensing reasons.</p>
