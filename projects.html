					<p>Seeing as the insurance is covering a bit of the repaint for the bus I thought we might as well tidy up the whole thing. The paintjob was done at Alan Rea Panelbeaters. It was a bit of a hassle finding replacement roof lights and paints took ages to come. All done now and fairly happy with it, lots of minor bumps and imperections still but hey this isn't the Mona Lisa :).</p>

					<h2>A tree falls on the bus :(</h2>
					<p>The day after we returned from our summer holidays this happens, dents the top front of the bus, breaks a couple lights and a window wiper.</p>
					<p>One very lucky passerby is missed by the flying branch.</p>

					<h2>COF inspection and repairs</h2>
					<p>When I did our last COF I wasn't thinking of when it would be due next. Unfortunately, it ran out on the 1st Jan, and even though we knew this prior to going on holiday we decided to just take our chances on our trip even if it meant being in a town for a few days without insurance and the COF. We decided to use Napier as our base where we were lucky enough to be given a family members empty house for a few days. It turned out the breaks needed work and we had a broken leaf spring. The leaf spring proved to be a bit tricky and ended up needing a replacement to be manufactured. There was a cockup with the replacement part and needed to be redone and sent again. We ended up being in Napier for a week, which luckily we could adjust our travel plans to accommodate the repairs.</p>

					<h2>Water filter tap fitted</h2>
					<p>With two little kids on board I wanted to feel more confident about the cleanliness of our water sources as we travel around, and that includes the cleanliness of our water tank. Who knows what the tank looks like on the inside, although it is a stainless tank which is said to be a great material to limit bacteria growth.</p>
					<p>Time was short before going away so I just got a professional to come and fit it. Filter should last 1-2 with the amount we use it.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Split the top bunk into two beds to accommodate Leon</h2>
					<p>Because Leon outgrew both of his previous basinets I had to come up with a new idea. I ended up creating a little enclosure for him on the back part of the top bunk. Luckily Isaac is still small enough for this to work out. I only built this two days before we headed off on our big trip. Leon loved his little space, apart from us bumping his head getting him in and out and the mild heat in the early evenings.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Indoor hammock</h2>
					<p>I've had a hammock lying around since forever, it got some use on camping trips when we could find the right spot but it doesn't happen much. I picked two pillars to attach a hammock above the front seats of the bus. The hammock just misses the gear stick and can be left in place when not in use or driving by pinning it up behind the sun visors—works a treat, we all love it, rain or shine its a nice spot to be.</p>

					<h2>Swivel TV embedded within the wall (work in progress)</h2>
					<p>With less than two weeks left before we head off on our summer holiday trip, I'm tearing things apart again to fit the TV into the wall so that it spins 360deg. This will mean it can be used from both ends of the bus.</p>
					<p>For a long time I've been planning this spinning TV. It was extremely tricky and messy, but its strong, and I'm happy with the result so far. The TV spins freely, and has a little stopper which fixes it in place when driving. It's going to be finished with a surface layer of ply to clean things up. It was well worth the effort and used a fair bit on our <a href="../post-15.html">Christmas break trip</a>.</p>

					<h2>Tidied up 12v power and sockets in sleeping area</h2>
					<p>I'm prepping some sockets and power for the TV to be built into the wall. I will be adding a shelf for smaller items which will hide the ports and switches and provide a good place for charging phones and keeping smaller items away from the kids.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Storage box by driver</h2>
					<p>There is a constant effort which goes into maximising space within the bus. There was some dead space next to the drivers seat so I've' built a box to house bits and bobs for electronics and keep them out of the way.</p>

					<h2>Wool insulation part 1</h2>
					<p>The project continues to grow, because I am aiming to reline and redo the cabinets, I decided I might as well do insulation in the walls. After much investigation into the in and outs of materials and thermal barriers I decided to go with a product called Terratherma which is a blend of natural wool and polyester. It holds its shape as a batt and was easy to split down the middle to make it the same thickness as the wall cavities. So far I've only done the right wall from the back of the living quarters up through to the seating area. The shower area will be done later when that is renovated and the front area would require all the seats to come out which I'm not ready to do as yet. Now that that section of insulation is complete it can be lined with ply (stacked up in my living room waiting for more time).</p>

					<h2>More 240v plugs added</h2>
					<p>We added some 240v outlets under the dinette table as we previously only had plugs at the kitchen bench. This meant if you were using a computer at the table, power cables ran across the isle—not the best situation with small kids. It's the perfect time with insuation currently being fitted.</p>

					<h2>Ply delivery</h2>
					<p>I wasn't able to get hold of the Kauri play I originally started with so I've made a pretty dramatic change to Euro Poplar Ply. It wasn't what I originally wanted, but I need to move on. It comes in loads of thicknesses and even though it's really pale it can be lacquered or stained if need be, it's lightweight and recommended for RV's.</p><p> I thought the Kauri had loads of character and warmth, but I don't have much choice but make a change.</p>
					<p>Now my living room has a stack load of ply behind the couch waiting to be cut up and installed.</p>
					<p>I also manage to score some Birch ply from Trademe which I think will be used for draw fronts and doors as its nicer looking and already finished with a finish for protecting.</p>

					<h2>Baby bassinet</h2>
					<p>Leon has out grown the Moses basket so I've fitted a bassinet in the same spot. At just under a metre long he should be able to fit for at least another year.</p>
					<p>I bought it second hand off Trademe, I've replaced the two ends so I still have all the parts to reasemble to its original state. It leaves plenty of space underneath for our feet. The side folds down to easily get Leon in and out.</p>
					<p>He's had naps in it and an overnighter already and it worked perfectly. Isaacs painted the replacement ends of the cot so it's pretty unique at the moment. Bus is a mess at the moment from the fitting the insulation.</p>

					<h2>Kids seat pockets</h2>
					<p>Space for teddies, books, iPad and bits and pieces. All at hands reach for those long drives. I'm, using vertical felt vertical grow pockets which we've had for a while, but never ended up using in the garden.</p>
					<p>I've also fitted pockets to the back of the driver's seat as well, which has USB charging, tissue holder, and an assortment of other shaped pockets for bits and pieces.</p>

					<h2>Moving on to a different type of ply</h2>
					<p>So after about 6 months trying to source more Kauri ply I've come to the realization that I need to move on to another wood type because it's too hard to get. Although Kauri was the look I was going for it seems its not going to be available in the near future as they've stopped importing it into the country. So onto selecting a replacement, I'm considering Euro Poplar, Birch, Gaboon, or Meranti.</p>

					<h2>Diesel filter cap rethreaded</h2>
					<p>Due to an airlock in diesel fuel line we had a few temporary breakdowns. Managed to get help from the previous owner over the phone who helped to clear the lines. During the process I found some bolts on the diesel filters de-threaded. Made a temporary fix by borrowing plumbing tape from someone at a campsite which meant I could get it out to a mechanic prior to taking it to the Hawkes Bay. I got my first taste of bus maintenance, pretty stressful, but it all worked out. I got covered in diesel in the process as well as through the isle of the bus.</p>

					<h2>Skylight blind v2</h2>
					<p>So my first attempt at creating a wooden skylight blind failed back in Dec 2019, it was too heavy, bulky and the wood warped. Version two is some blackout blind material with a few rods sewn in to keep it tight when up. So far so good, it folds up nicely, keeps things super dark, and is easy to install.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Festoon lights for the awning</h2>
					<p>I've created a place to just plug these directly within the boot. Haven't tested them out properly in the evening as I'm not sure if they will attract the mozzies.</p>

I've also got waterproof and blackout material to attach to them, but I don't think I'll need them as its super dark already with just the blanket it seems dry enough to avoid damp and mold (I'll keep an eye on them).</p>
					<p>I'm leaving the original curtains in place as well, which are more for privacy during the day. The magnet blinds are to really make the sleeping area extra dark for day time naps by the kids and those long sleep ins after one too many nightcaps.</p>

					<h2>Child &amp; dog safety gate</h2>
					<p>I've added a child safety gate at the top of the stairs to avoid kids/dog running out on the road if the door is open. This should allow us to leave the door open and allow the breeze to flow through without the added danger.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Skylight blind</h2>
					<p>To avoid the sun beaming through the skylight and air vent in the morning I created two covers to block out the light. The wood from larger of the two warped after a few hot days, so another solution is going to be needed soon, it will hold up for now though.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Cup shelf</h2>
					<p>A minor improvement to store more cups under the bench top, which helps to utilize some empty space and helps to hide the sink bowl at the same time.</p>
					<p>At the same time I hacked up a basket under the sink so it could act as a vertical plate stacker. It seems to be working well so I  might try to think of a more elegant way of doing this so the plates don't move so much.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Awning bust, and fixed again :)</h2>
					<p>On our last trip to Kaitoki we discovered that the awning doesn't retract as it should. When winding it in you can hear a cog slipping, we really needed that awning as it was too hot in the bus. I've figured out it was a 2005 modal Thule Omnistor and was able to order a new part (Cranking Gear Assembly) and install it prior to heading away for summer.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Gumboot rack</h2>
					<p>Since the boot of the bus is pretty much our garage and a little bit of a wet area (mindful of the electrics though), a gumboot rack made sense to keep them from flying about. Super simple and accessible along with heavy our rain gear.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Coal BBQ storage box</h2>
					<p>The bus has its own coal BBQ stored in the boot and I've fashioned a couple of old fruit wooden boxes to house it along with coal, paper, wood etc. Mixed success so far, I really need a coal starter as I'm not patient enough.</p>

					<h2>Babies cot and change table</h2>

					<p>Something pretty major has just changed in our lives—we have a new addition to the family. Wee Leon has joined the adventure and what better excuse to adjust the sleeping quarters of the bus again. I've added a little platform for a Babyco Moses Basket to float above our bed, the platform also doubles as a changing table when the basket is removed, the changing mat is also removable so we can use it elsewhere. The platform is repurposed from the changing table part of a Caraboo cot. It's suspended from the top bunk by a couple straps and can be leveled as required if the bus isn't.</p>
					<p>After a test run today we found its a really good solution, plenty of space for our feet without bumping the baby and enough headroom to get him in and out. Best of all it sways which can be used to rock the baby to sleep.</p>

					<h2>Bed headboard and headboard light</h2>
					<p>Because there's a bit of a gap between the double mattress and the back wall I've made a headboard to fill the gap. It's an old foam mattress which makes for a pretty comfy headboard and provides and extra thermal layer between the sleeping area and the back of the bus.</p>
					<p>Kim had some fabric lying around which I've used to cover the foam and I had a board up in the attic to give the headboard some strength. I sliced the mattress up with an electric bread knife to form the shape, with special attention to ensure the bunk still goes up and down by splitting the headboard into a main piece and a smaller piece which can be used if the bunk is up or if the bunk is down (against the wall).</p>
					<p>Added a bendy <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33044272846.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">LED reading light</a> above the headboard which can be positioned for the top bunk or the main bed. Apart from being positionable it also has bright/warm white as well as dimming, making it perfect for our purpose.</p>
					<p>I was thinking I might splash out at some stage to purchase some thick wool felt material to cover it, but for now there's more important things to do.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Tunes</h2>
					<p>Something I used to do when I was younger was making mix tapes for road trips and holidays, bring back the old days I say! Every now and then you'd find the old playlist and it brings back those memories.</p>
					<p>I've actually dug out my old iPod fully loaded with tunes from at least 10 years ago, and my bag of mini-discs, some of those mixes are well worth digging back up. They'll plug straight into the stereo system so should be good for the drive.</p>

						<div style="background-image: url('./images/gallery/ceiling_down.jpg');"></div>
					</a>
					<p>I had to remove some of the boards and carpet on the back wall to put in the bunk bed, while I was at it I decided to remove the ceiling fabric as it was sagging anyway—so it looks like I'm pretty much redoing the whole back bedroom now. On the opposite side from the bunk there is an old large air duct which is pretty much an empty void, I've removed it as well which I'll replace with an open shelf.</p>
					<p>I was going to reline the ceiling with Gaboon (Okume) ply but decided at the last minute to go Kauri. I can slowly work my way to the front of the bus with a similar style throughout.</p>
					<p>I'll be adding two strips of LED lighting down the roof line and some fast charging USB ports to the back wall for mobile phones. I think even my laptop can charge from those USB ports? Although we have an inverter on board anyway.</p>
					<p>It's all taking a lot longer than I anticipated, all those curves and fitting it around the skylights, lights, light switches, and air vents. I added a vent cover in rear which I'll need to replicate at the front when I get that far.<p>
					<p>Update: so apparently Kauri ply comes from Fiji and all supplies to NZ has stopped, so now I potentially can't get anymore. When I purchased it, I was assured more would be coming, but I've rung around NZ to find more but there isn't any! It's all at the Fijian docks in containers with some legal battle. What to do? Continue with what I have or swap it out now for another wood.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>LED lights and power points</h2>
					<img class="simple-image border-radius-8 right-50" src="./images/gallery/USB.png" />
					<p>With the plywood saga going on, I've moved on to wiring up the LED light strips which run down either side of the main sheet of ply running down the middle of the ceiling. I've got one side fitted and working, using a remote or phone you have the ability to dim the lights and change colours. I plan to fit another strip today above the bunk bed. So after that I'll move back to the fitting of the remaining ply I've got left.</p>
					<p>I'm plan on installing multiple <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32950195479.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">USB charge stations</a> throughout the bus, but I've only started by installing one at the top of the bed.</p><br />

					<h2>GPS tracker installation</h2>
					<p>I've been pretty casual with parking my bus in places which aren't the safest, for a little bit more piece of mind I've purchased a GPS tracker for the bus.</p>
					<p>It's a fairly simple device which will alert me if it moves, or by sending it an SMS it will let me know it's location.</p>
					<p>Purchased off AliExpress for about $30, so far it's been easy to set up. I have the bus being tracked on a map, which is useful for seeing the distance traveled and recording the route we take.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Movie projector</h2>
					<p>After a bit of research I purchased a projector for the home which we could also use with bus outings.</p>
					<p>The idea is that it'll be used on either the outside of the bus or on a projector screen which pulls down from above the kitchen bench. I'm looking forward to trying it out properly, I just need some good family movies downloaded now.</p>
					<p>Word of warning, it heats up quite a lot, so not the best for indoor use in a small space on a hot day (we did try). Also during summer it hasn't been dark enough until after 9pm, Isaac is already in bed by then. It might get more use in the in-between seasons when it goes dark a little early or its a bit cooler indoors to run the projector.</p>

						<p>I've purchased a trundler bed from Trademe which I'll use for the frame. I've had to take away the cupboards above the main double bed to make space and I'll also be moving the TV to the other side of the bus (I've removed it all together for now).</p>
