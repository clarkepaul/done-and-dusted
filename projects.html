					<h2>Babies bassinet</h2>
					<p>Leon has out grown the Moses basket so I've fitted a basinet in the same spot. At just under a metre long he should be able to fit for at least another year.</p>
					<p>I bought it second hand off Trademe, I'm replacing the two ends so it leaves plenty of space underneath for our feet. I've made the side fold down to easily get Leon in and out.</p>
					<p>He's had naps in it and overnighter already and it worked perfectly. Isaacs painted the replacement ends of the cot so its pretty unique at the moment.</p>

					<p>I've also fitted pockets to the back of the drivers seat as well which has USB charging, tissue holder and an assortment of other shaped pockets for bits and pieces.</p>

					<h2>Moving on to a different type of ply</h2>
					<p>So after about 6 months trying to source more Kauri ply I've come to the realisation that I need to move on to another wood type because its too hard to get. Although Kauri was the look I was going for it seems its not going to be available in the near future as they've stop importing it into the country. So onto selecting a replacement, I'm considering Euro Poplar, Birch, Gaboon, or Meranti.</p>

					<h2>Deisel filter cap rethreaded</h2>
					<p>Due to an airlock in deisel fuel line we had a few temporary breakdowns. Managed to get help from the previous owner over the phone who helped to clear the lines. During the process I found some bolts on the deisel filters de-threaded. Made a temporary fix by borrowing plumbing tape from someone at a campsite which meant I could get it out to a mechanic prior to taking it to the Hawkes Bay. I got my first taste of bus maintenance, pretty stressful but it all worked out. I got cover in deisel in the process as well as through the isle of the bus.</p>

					<h2>Skylight blind v2</h2>
					<p>So my first attempt at creating a wooden skylight blind failed back in Dec 2019, it was too heavy, bulky and the wood warped. Version two is blackout blind material with a few rods sewn in to keep it tight when up. So far so good, it folds up nicely, keeps things super dark, and is easily to install.</p>

					<h2>Blackout thermal magnetic curtains</h2>
					<p>I've started to build wooden frames around the bedroom windows so I'm able to screw magnets to them. A <a href="https://www.bunnings.co.nz/wrap-move-1-8-x-3-2m-premium-moving-blanket_p2610107">wool moving blanket</a> acting as both a thermal barrier and blackout blind will snap into place by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000865162801.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.16004c4d2ziKTR">neodymium magnets</a> for easy attachment and removal. I've also got waterproof and blackout material to attach to them but I don't think I'll need them as its super dark already with just the blanket it seems dry enough to avoid damp and mould (I'll keep an eye on them).</p>
					<p>I'm leaving the original curtains in place as well which are more for privacy during the day. The magnet blinds are to really make the sleeping area extra dark for day time naps by the kids and those long sleepins after one too many nightcaps.</p>

					<h2>Child &amp; dog safety gate</h2>
					<p>I've added a child safety gate at the top of the stairs to avoid kids/dog running out on the road if the door is open. This should allow us to leave the door open and allow the breeze to flow through without the added danger.</p>
					<br />

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>Skylight blind</h2>
					<p>To avoid the sun beaming through the skylight and air vent in the morning I created two covers to block out the light. The wood from larger of the two warped after a few hot days so another solution is going to be needed soon, it will hold up for now though.</p>

					<h2>Cup shelf</h2>
					<p>A minor improvement to store more cups under the bench top, which helps to utilise some empty space and helps to hide the sink bowl at the same time.</p>
					<p>At the same time I hacket up a basket under the sink so it could act as a vertical plate stacker. It seems to be working well so I  might try to think of a more elegant way of doing this so the plates don't move so much.</p>

					<h2>Awning bust, and fixed again :)</h2>
					<p>On our last trip to Kaitoki we discovered that the awning doesn't retract as it should. When winding it in you can hear a cog slipping, we really needed that awning as it was too hot in the bus. I've figured out it was a 2005 modal Thule Omnistor and was able to order a new part (Cranking Gear Assembly) and install it prior to heading away for summer.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>Gumboot rack</h2>
					<p>Since the boot of the bus is pretty much our garage and a little bit of a wet area (mindfull of the electrics though), a gumboot rack made sense to keep them from flying about. Super simple and accessible along with heavy our rain gear.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>Coal BBQ storage box</h2>
					<p>The bus has its own coal BBQ stored in the boot and I've fashioned a couple of old fruit wooden boxes to house it along with coal, paper, wood etc. Mixed success so far, I really need a coal starter as I'm not patient enough.</p>

					<h2>Babies cot and change table</h2>
					<p>Something pretty major has just changed in our lives—we have a new addition to the family. Wee Leon has joined the adventure and what better excuse to adjust the sleeping quaters of the bus again. I've added a little platform for a Babyco Moses Basket to float above our bed, the platform also doubles as a changing table when the basket is removed, the changing mat is also removable so we can use it elsewhere. The platform is repurposed from the changing table part of a Caraboo cot. It's susspended from the top bunk by a couple straps and can be leveled as required if the bus isn't.</p>
					<p>After a test run today we found its a really good solution, plenty of space for our feet without bumping the baby and enough head room to get him in and out. Best of all it sways which can be used to rock the baby to sleep.</p>

					<h2>Bed headboard and headboard light</h2>
					<p>Because there's a bit of a gap between the double mattress and the back wall I've made a headboard to fill the gap. It's an old foam mattress which makes for a pretty comfy headboard and provides and extra thermal layer between the sleeping area and the back of the bus.</p>
					<p>Kim had some fabric lying around which I've used to cover the foam and I had a board up in the attic to give the headboard some strength. I sliced the mattress up with an electric bread knife to form the shape, with special attention to ensure the bunk still goes up and down by splitting the headboard into a main piece and a smaller piece which can be used if the bunk is up or if the bunk is down (against the wall).</p>
					<p>Added a bendy <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33044272846.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">LED reading light</a> above the headboard which can be positioned for the top bunk or the main bed. Apart from being positionable it also has bright/warm white as well as dimming making it perfect for our purpose.</p>
					<p>I was thinking I might splash out at some stage to purchase some thick wool felt material to cover it but for now there's more important things to do.</p>

					<h2>Tunes</h2>
					<p>Something I used to do when I was younger was make mix tapes for road trips and holidays, bring back the old days I say! Every now and then you'd find the old playlist and it brings back those memories.</p>
					<p>I've actually dug out my old iPod fully loaded with tunes from at least 10 years ago, and my bag of mini-discs, some of those mixes are well worth digging back up. They'll plug straight into the stereo system so should be good for the drive.</p>
					<p>Here's some samples of a playlist I started to put together for a trip, unfortunately I can't provide the full length playlist for licensing reasons.</p>

					<h2>Re-lining the bedroom roof in ply</h2>
					<p>I had to remove some of the boards and carpet on the back wall to put in the bunk bed, while I was at it I decided to remove the ceiling fabric as it was sagging anyway—so it looks like I'm pretty much redoing the whole back bedroom now. On the opposite side from the bunk there is an old large air duct which is pretty much an empty void, I've removed it as well which I'll replace with an open shelf.</p>
					<p>I was going to reline the ceiling with Gaboon (Okume) ply but decided at the last minute to go Kauri. I can slowly work my way to the front of the bus with a similar style throughout.</p>
					<p>I'll be adding two strips of LED lighting down the roof line and some fast charging USB ports to the back wall for mobile phones. I think even my laptop can charge from those USB ports? although we have an inverter onboard anyway.</p>
					<p>It's all taking a lot longer than I anticipated, all those curves and fitting it around the skylights, lights, light switches, and air vents. I added a vent cover in rear which I'll need to replicate at the front when I get that far.<p>
					<p>Update: so apparently Kauri ply comes from Fiji and all supplies to NZ has stopped, so now I potentially can't get anymore. When I purchased it I was assured more would br coming but I've rung around NZ to find more but there isn't any! It's all at the Fijian docks in containers with some legal battle. What to do? continue with what I have or swap it out now for another wood.</p>

					<h2>LED lights and power points</h2>
					<img class="simple-image border-radius-8 right-50" src="./images/gallery/USB.png" />
					<p>With the plywood saga going on, I've moved onto wiring up the LED light strips which run down either side of the main sheet of ply running down the middle of the ceiling. I've got one side fitted and working, using a remote or phone you have the ability to dim the lights and change colours. I plan to fit another strip today above the bunk bed. So after that I'll move back to the fitting of the remaining ply I've got left.</p>
					<p>I'm installing multiple <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32950195479.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">USB charge stations</a> throughout the bus but installed one at the top of the bed.</p><br />

					<h2>GPS tracker installation</h2>
					<p>I've been pretty casual with parking my bus in places which aren't the safest, for a little bit more piece of mind I've purchased a GPS tracker for the bus.</p>
					<p>It's a fairly simple device which will alert me if it moves, or by sending it a SMS it will let me know it's location.</p>
					<p>Purchased off AliExpress for about $30, so far it's been easy to setup. I have the bus being tracked on a map, which is useful for seeing the distance traveled and recording the route we take.</p>
					<br />
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h2>Movie projector</h2>
					<p>After a bit of research I purchased a projector for the home which we could also use with bus outings.</p>
					<p>The idea is that it'll be used on the outside of the bus itself for movie nights, or in the courtyard at home. I've done a few successful test runs and the built-in speakers seem fine. I'm looking forward to trying it out properly, I just need some good family movies downloaded now.</p>
					<p><i>Update, so it all works fine but it heats up quite a lot so not the best for indoor use on a hot day (we did try). Also during summer it hasn't been that useful as it doesn't go dark enough until after 9pm, Isaac is already in bed by then. So I guess we'll look forward to the inbetween seasons when it goes dark a little early or its a bit cooler indoors to run the projector.</i>

					<h2>Kids bunk bed</h2>
					<p>I'm building a bunk bed for the kids above the main fixed double bed. We're keeping all the sleeping areas in the back section of the bus so the dinning area can be used in the evenings. The bunk will be easily stored away by folding into the wall like a Murphy Bed.
						<p>I've purchased a trundler bed from Trademe which I'll use for the frame. I've had to take away the cupboards above the main double bed to make space and I'll also be moving the TV to the other side of the bus (I've removed it all together for now).</p>
						<p>Next will be to create a guard rail to stop Isaac falling out of the bed.</p>
